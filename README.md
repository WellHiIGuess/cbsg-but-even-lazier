# Corporate Bullshit Generator for Java

This is the [Corporate Bullshit Generator](http://cbsg.sf.net/) rewritten in Java. 
Implementation is based on [franciscouzo](https://github.com/franciscouzo/corporate_bullshit)'s 
Python code.

## Usage
Actually this is how it works:

Simple run `java -jar cbsg-1.0.0.jar` then "short workshop" will be generated.
there are some supported parameters for dedicated workspace influencers.

```shell
java -jar cbsg-1.0.0.jar --help

Available options:
--workshop
--shortWorkshop
--financialReport
--sentenceGuaranteedAmount=<ANY_INTEGER>

--configurationProperties=<DICTIONARY_PROPERTIES_FROM_CLASSPATH>
--help

```

## Examples

```
Our challenge is not to learn phased and pre-approved cubes. Our challenge is to challenge established ideas. The correlations transfers the pioneers, relative to our peers, while the glocalization get from here to heres in this spa
ce. The blockchain influences the thinkers/planners in this space. A pyramid will be best positioned to analyse the 'why' behind on-premise and spot-on matrices. The social implications iterates our multi-divisional and differentia
ting roll-out by thinking outside of the box.
